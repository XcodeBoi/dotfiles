# dotfiles
I don't use a dotfile manager. This repo is just ~/.config
# systems
This is a cross between my manjaro and macos .config files. uh i just kind of hope there isnt a conflict somewhere. its sort of lunacy.
# spacebar
I use a seperate daemon to update spacebar with various things. Located [here](https://github.com/XcodeBoi/spacebar-updater)
## spacebar issues
booting causes all sorts of issues with spacebar. every time I turn on my computer I have to restart the service and manually reenable left shell output. A small script for the shell output is included.
